Allows to define a slug for each language and some qTranslate bug fixes

== Description ==

[Qtranslate](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qtranslate/) is a nice plugin but unfortunately today is **outdated**. **Qtranslate Slug** is an addon to qTranslate, which adds support for permalinks translations and fix some qTranslate deficiencies.

**Version 1.0** has been written from scratch using OOP. The code has been structured better, the functions have been marked and commented and everything is better integrated with Wordpress API.

This plugin works with **Qtranslate** versions **2.5.8** and **2.5.9**.

= What is new? =

* new branch, the plugin has been rewritten: now the code is commented and wrapped inside a class, much code has change and the performance has been increased.
* no ID for slug type, then don't install `qtrasnlate_slug` table.
* slugs now are stored on meta tables, installation creates a termmeta table with some new *core functions* to access/save data, based on [simple term meta](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-term-meta/).
* the plugin generates translated slug automatically from title in empty cases.
* the plugin checks if the slug already exists (per each language and `post_type`/`taxonomy`), and adds a progressive number in this case
* works on ajax requests for example when new taxonomies are created in edit post page.
* possibility to translate the base of permastructs for `post_types` and *taxonomies*, uses [$wp_rewrite](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Rewrite).
* added some filters (see below).
* added plugin language textdomain (.pot file).
* new admin options page for save the base permastructs.
* import process when the plugin updates older versions.
* updated **Language selector Widget**.
* some bug fixes.
* some Qtranslate patches.

= Plugin filters = 

* `qts_validate_post_slug` : args( $post (object), $slug (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the post slug before is saved on the database.
* `qts_validate_term_slug` : args( $term (object), $slug (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the term slug before is saved on the database.
* `qts_current_url` : args ( $url (string), $lang (string) ) / filter to process the entire url after it has been generated.
* `qts_permastruct` : args ( $permastruct (string), $name (string) ) / filter to process the permastruct, used for change the base.

1. That's all!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It works with posts and pages, but with other content type? =

This plugin allows to translate slugs of: posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags and custom taxonomies.

= Do I have to configure anything? =

If you want to translate also the base permastructs (ex. **category**, **tag**, etc). Visit the plugin settings page in the admin **Settings** > **Slug options**

= How can i insert a language selector in my theme ? =

You can choose to:
* use **Qtranslate Slug Widget** in your sidebar.
* place in your template `<?php if (function_exists('qts_language_menu') ) qts_language_menu('text'); ?>`. Options are: `dropdown`, `text`, `image`, and `both`.

= Appears an error 404, what can i do? =
